# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

## v1.6.5-mj261.4 (2026-09-15)

### Changed

- fix(matter): preserve Eco, Normal, and Max suction choices for every RV3020 cleaning method

## v1.6.5-mj261.3 (2026-09-14)

### Changed

- fix(matter): track RV3020 cleaning, return-to-dock, charging, and docked states from its live robot status
- fix: load the authoritative MARD map so Matter shows every room with its SharkClean display name
- feat: translate MARD display names back to robot zone ids for RV3020 room cleaning

## v1.6.5 (2026-08-21)

### Changed

- fix: add vacuums that only appear on the newer sharkninja api, instead of finding none at all
- fix: give a vacuum the newer api has no name for a real name, instead of calling it unnamed
- chore(deps): dependency updates

## v1.6.4 (2026-08-09)

### Changed

- chore: remove personal funding links
- docs: add node 26 to the supported node versions
- chore: exclude test files and the test config from the published package
- fix: remove every stale accessory, instead of skipping every other one
- fix: keep the vacuums when the account list comes back empty
- fix: stop writing login tokens into the debug log
- fix: register a vacuum that does not report a room list, instead of failing outright
- fix: stop claiming an email and password login the plugin does not have
- fix: back off when shark asks the plugin to slow down, and stop polling on shutdown
- fix: drop the unreachable email and password login path, which could never run
- fix: clamp the docked update interval, so a very large value cannot make it poll every millisecond
- chore(deps): dependency updates

## v1.6.3 (2026-07-31)

### Changed

- feat: report battery level and charging state, and expose the eco, normal and max suction levels over matter (#88)
- fix(matter): tag the suction levels as vacuum modes, so the accessory registers instead of showing as no response (#88)
- feat: report errors, water tank and mop plate state over both hap and matter (#88)
- fix(matter): refresh the vacuum state shortly after a command, so home reflects it straight away instead of up to a poll later (#88)
- fix(matter): show the battery while the vacuum is charging, and put the normal suction level back in the home mode list (#88)
- fix(matter): actually pause the vacuum when home asks, and make play sound to locate work (#88)

## v1.6.2 (2026-07-30)

### Changed

- chore: keep test files out of the published package
- chore(github): run the build and tests in ci, on node 22, 24 and 26
- chore: use the same lint setup across every plugin
- chore: add a changelog:sync script to populate the pending section from the commits
- chore: count a repeated commit subject once when syncing the changelog
- chore(github): check the changelog against the commits in ci
- chore(deps): dependency updates
- fix: explain that a failed code exchange usually means the login code was already used or has expired, instead of reporting a bare http error (#84)
- chore: log which properties the new api returns, and whether the vacuum reports a room list (#41)
- chore: log the value of all three area filter properties, to find which one the vacuum acts on (#41)
- feat: clean individual rooms, selectable from the matter service area, using the newer json area filter the vacuum expects (#41)
- fix(matter): declare supportedMaps on the service area cluster, so a vacuum with rooms registers instead of showing as no response (#41)
- fix: use the app's plain room clean by default instead of matrix clean, with a config option for matrix clean (#41)

## v1.6.1 (2026-07-28)

### Changed

- fix: use the european callback address when the eu region is selected, so the login page no longer rejects it as an allowed callback url (#85)
- docs(github): name this plugin's devices in the issue forms instead of meater
- fix: do not crash the whole plugin when a vacuum does not report a model or serial number (#85)
- fix(schema): declare required fields the standard way so the homebridge ui stops reporting a config validation failure
- chore: declare the supports-hap transport keyword for the homebridge ui
- fix: ignore non-vacuum appliances on your sharkninja account, instead of adding them to homekit as vacuums (#85)
- chore(deps): dependency updates

## v1.6.0 (2026-07-25)

### Changed

- fix: actually start the vacuum when its control is switched on, instead of the switch doing nothing and reverting to off (#68)
- fix(matter): handle the home app's play, pause and dock buttons, so the vacuum responds instead of rejecting the command (#68)
- fix: start a whole-house clean with just the start command, so the vacuum actually leaves the dock instead of being told to clean no areas (#68)
- chore: log the start command and whether shark accepts it in debug mode, to diagnose a vacuum that will not leave the dock from homekit (#68)
- style(ui): standardise the custom ui layout and sync the support tab with the readme
- fix(ui): fall back to the older copy command when the clipboard api is unavailable, so the oauth url copy button works over plain http (#84)
- feat: send vacuum commands through the newer sharkninja api that the current sharkclean app uses, so newer vacuums actually respond, keeping ayla as the fallback (#68)
- chore: log whether each vacuum is live on the new api and read the state back after a mode command, to diagnose a start command that the api accepts but the vacuum ignores (#68)
- feat: read the vacuum state from the newer sharkninja api too, so homekit shows the true cleaning status for vacuums that no longer report to ayla (#68)
- chore(deps): dependency updates

## v1.5.2 (2026-07-22)

### Changed

- chore(github): release on a published github release, not every push to latest
- chore(github): align workflows, funding and issue templates with the other org plugins
- chore: standardise the eslint setup and apply the org lint rules

- chore: standardise the package manifest with the other org plugins
- docs: add claude and copilot instructions files
- docs: use the standard org readme banner
- chore(deps): dependency updates
- fix(matter): include the required error state so the robot vacuum registers over matter (#79)
- fix: match configured vacuum DSNs ignoring case and spaces, and log the discovered DSNs to make configuration easier (#64, #70)
- fix: add every vacuum on the account when no DSNs are configured, instead of erroring out (the documented single-vacuum workaround) (#64, #68)
- fix(ui): register the OAuth login handlers with the leading slash the UI calls, so "Generate Login URL" no longer fails with "No Registered Handler" (#18)
- fix(matter): drop the operational state labels that newer Matter rejects, so the robot vacuum registers over Matter again (#83)
